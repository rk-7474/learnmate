### An AI integrated text editor

I've created Learnmate in 2023, when OpenAI APIs were public and free. The idea was very simple: a text editor with integrated AI tools to summarize, deepen or explain parts of text, with an integrated chat to ask for other informations or generate some questions and quizzes to evaluate the user about the written content.
I started working on it a year before NotebookLM even existed; i was very proud of it at the time. I stopped working on this because of the lack of knowledge and the high cost of tokens, after OpenAI made the APIs private.

Made with sveltekit, using only client side code, because i had never tried server sided code in svelte then ðŸ˜¬ (don't judge me for this please)
